- Type of challenge: consolidation
- Repository: Hangman
- Challenge: solo
- Duration : 3 days
- Deadline : 12/08/2020, 10:00 am

## Mission

Make a website version of the hangman word game. To do so try to think the structure, the backend (functionality) and the frontend (design) of your project before you start coding.

## At the very least your version of the hangman should:

- propose an hidden word
- allow the selection of letters
- verify if a selected letter belongs to the word
- count the number of failure (lives)
- check if it's a game over
- check if the word as been found

- Optionally it can:

- keep in memory all guessed letters
- only let the player guess a letter once

## Bonus:

- use canvas
- NOTE: The instructions below are meant to guide you not impose a way of doing things, what matters is the end result.

## Instructions:

- create the repository
- think the project through
- write the backend (make it functional) 
- write the frontend (make it pretty)
- implement both parts into a web page
